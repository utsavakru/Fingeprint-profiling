# Fingeprint-profiling
Fingerprint scanning on the go to ease your authentication and in addition used to save your time.Instead of creating a traditional image of a fingerprint, capacitive fingerprint scanners use arrays tiny capacitor circuits to collect data about a fingerprint. As capacitors can store electrical charge, connecting them up to conductive plates on the surface of the scanner allows them to be used to track the details of a fingerprint.

# Fingerprint authentication:
This release offers new APIs to let you authenticate users by using their fingerprint scans on supported devices, Use these APIs in conjunction with the Android Keystore system.
To authenticate users via fingerprint scan, get an instance of the new FingerprintManager class and call the authenticate() method. Your app must be running on a compatible device with a fingerprint sensor. You must implement the user interface for the fingerprint authentication flow on your app, and use the standard Android fingerprint icon in your UI. The Android fingerprint icon (c_fp_40px.png) is included in the Fingerprint Dialog sample. If you are developing multiple apps that use fingerprint authentication, note that each app must authenticate the userâ€™s fingerprint independently. 

# To develop,
To start building apps for Android 6.0, you must first get the Android SDK. Then use the SDK Manager to download the Android 6.0 SDK Platform and System Images.

Happy Developing !!!
